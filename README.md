==Pages Description== 
The Home Page allows users to customize the pizza they would like to order, by clicking the start order button which opens a modal that has all the customization options 
such as size and pizza toppings. The Home Page also has a carousel that displays different pizzas. When the user is finished customizing their pizza they are then taken to 
the order page where the details of the pizza is shown such as the price of the toppings and the size of the pizza. On this page the user could either edit their order or proceed  
to the final page. On the final page the final details of the pizza is shown along with a estimated time for pick up. Each page has a navbar with a logo that when clicked carries 
the user back to the home page.
